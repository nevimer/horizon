# Changelogs

Changelogs are automatically generated by a workflow running the `ingest_pr_changelog.py` python script, by reading the Pull Request's body and parsing the changelog into a yml file.


## Requirements

Please see `requirements.txt` for what packages are needed and/or use it directly with pip <nobr>(`pip install -r requirements.txt`)</nobr> to install all required dependencies.

Else, this was written with `Python 3.9` and above in mind.


## Usage
By default, the repository workflows should work out of the box, but the scripts can also be invoked manually.

Simply running them with the `-h` argument will print helpful information on what to supply the script.


## DIY

If you want to create a changelog entry yourself, you can create a .yml file in the <nobr>`html/changelogs`</nobr> directory with the following template:

```yml
# <-- This symbol means that this is a comment, and is purely informational
# It is NOT required to copy these into the new file.

# Your name goes here
# Anything goes, but try to keep it sane, use quotes if you use special characters.
author: MyNameHere

# This is a collection of your changes, please see `changetype_defs.json`
# For a full list of all valid types
# Each item goes in the format of
# - type: "Message/description of the change"
changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new wrench that honks on use."
  - rscdel: "Killed innocent kittens."

# This is the date of when this changelog should show up for,
# Normally this should be equal to the date these changes got merged.
merge-date: 1970-01-01

# This is the GitHub Pull Request number this change is associated with. Optional.
prnumber: 1337


# And again without any comments:
author: MyNameHere
changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new wrench that honks on use."
  - rscdel: "Killed innocent kittens."
merge-date: 1970-01-01
prnumber: 1337
```

The filename for these files do not matter, but for maintainer sanity's sake, a format of <nobr>`myusername-shortdescription-prnumber.yml`</nobr> is suggested.

For example: `atakiya-honkwrench-1337.yml`

Notes:
- Do not make the filename too long
- Do not add funky emojis, symbols or other litter
- Provide correct information

Not following these suggestions may cause the changelog compiler to invalidate the changelog.
