Welcome to the ~~magical modular~~ folder!

## Modularity

As of writing this at 9:33 PM EST on February 9th, 2023, we will be attempting to stay lightly modular to our upstream, Horizon. 

## Code folder

> Defines

Drop your defines in _defines. NOTE: Defines defined here will not work in the normal filers!

Why? Simple: Byond compiles things in order of hierarchy! running "tree" at the root of the folder
will give you a good idea how it works.

> Modules

Modules are for full features, or rewrites of Horizon/TG code.

> Overrides

Overrides are for procs that override the original Horizon/TG procs, or extend off them.

If you "..()" an already existing proc, it should go here unless you have good reason to not.

## Icons

As of writing, there is nothing here.

## Sounds

Sounds go here.

## License

MAKE SURE ANYTHING YOU IMPORT HAS A VALID PORTABLE LICENSE FOR THIS REPOSITORY
WE USE THE SAME LICENSE AS HORIZON, AND TGSTATION.
