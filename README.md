## About
Welcome to the Horizon Station 13 codebase.

Horizon13 is a mainly roleplay-centric Space Station 13 codebase, running via the BYOND engine.  
It features a relatively performant base, focus on maintaining performance and responsiveness for players, especially with UIs.

This codebase started as a fork from /tg/station in Q2 2021.  
The majority of code and assets is based off works from contributors at [/tg/station](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation)  
Other code and assets come or are inspired from the rest of the SS13 community, or are made entirely in-house.

## DOWNLOADING
[Downloading](.github/DOWNLOADING.md)

[Running on the server](.github/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md)

## ‚ùó How to compile ‚ùó

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `horizon.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building the codebase in DreamMaker directly is now deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.

**[How to compile in VSCode and other build options](tools/build/README.md).**
